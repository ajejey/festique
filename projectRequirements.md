Festique: A Ticketing App for Runners, Built with Next.js 14
App Focus: Festique will be a dedicated ticketing platform for marathon and running events, catering to both runners and event organizers. While the niche will be marathons and runs, the app will also offer various other events. So it has to be extensible and can be used for other events too.

Technologies:

Next.js 14: A modern React framework for building a fast and scalable app.
MongoDB: A flexible NoSQL database for storing event data, user information, and registrations.
